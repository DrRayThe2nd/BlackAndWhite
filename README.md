#### Instructions

The goal is to clear a white path across the grid by pressing squares. Doing this toggles the 8 surrounding squares and takes the pressed square out of action (this can be reset using the second 'power-up' below the title).

The other two 'power-ups' toggle all the squares, or allow you to toggle only a single square and not those around it.

Score is awarded for maximising the number of squares in the path, and points are deducted for remaining white squares and squares that you pressed. It's possible to lose points in a given round. The timer gets quicker with each level.

__Enjoy!__
